# tictactoeBOT
tictactoe bot project inspired from https://robertheaton.com/

Fun little project that uses python to render a simple board in the terminal
The actual Bot itself uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best moves for the bot.

The source files contains many of the precursor bots that have increasingly sophisticated logic coded in.
